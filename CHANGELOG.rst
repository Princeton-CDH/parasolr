0.9
---

* ``SolrQuerySet`` now supports Solr grouping via new `group`
  method and `GroupedResponse`

0.8.2
-----

* When subclassing ``SolrQuerySet``, result documents can now be customized by extending ``get_result_document``

0.8.1
-----
* Exclude proxy models when collecting indexable subclasses

0.8
---
* Pytest fixture ``mock_solr_queryset`` now takes optional argument for extra methods to include in fluent interface
* ``SolrQuerySet`` now supports highlighting on multiple fields via ``highlight`` method, with per-field highlighting options.

  except it adds instead of replacing field limit options.
* New ``parasolr.query.AliasedSolrQuerySet`` supports
  aliasing Solr fields to local names for use across all queryset methods
  and return values
* ``parasolr.indexing.Indexable`` now provides ``items_to_index()`` method
